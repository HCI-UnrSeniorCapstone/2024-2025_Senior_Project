  [NNGroup: Between-Subjects vs. Within-Subjects](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/between-within-subjects/)  
  This article from the Nielsen Norman Group explains the differences between between-subjects and within-subjects experimental designs, their advantages, disadvantages, and how to choose the right approach for usability testing and research.

**Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**  
  [Interaction Design Foundation: Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/human-computer-interaction)  
  This resource provides an overview of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), a multidisciplinary field focusing on designing and improving the interaction between people and computers, incorporating principles from psychology, design, and engineering."

    text: "Our story"
    body: "Nicholas Jarvis, Brandon Rowell, and Heather Zecther are students at the **University of Nevada, Reno** developing Fulcrum for their CS 426 Senior Project in Computer Science, Spring 2025 of the UNR CSE Department. Vinh Le and Levi Scully are UNR students serving as project advisors. Dave Feil-Seifer, Sara Davis, and Vinh Le are course instructors. The team identifies themselves by the project name, Fulcrum, and as Team 23.  
    Fulcrum is a web-based platform for performing HCI research studies, primarily by UNR graduate students. Nicholas Jarvis and Brandon Rowell make up the development team. Vinh Le serves as the project advisor/sponsor with Levi Scully working as a collaborator.  
  
    The project’s tech stack consists of: Vue3 for frontend, Flask for middleware, Python for backend, and MySQL for the database. A University linux VM operates as the server backend and database. Fulcrum offers users tools for study creation, session execution, data collection through various tracking mechanisms, and analytics. Offering customization and streamlining researcher workflows are the main focal points of the project, providing users a standardized solution/toolbox for conducting HCI studies."

    short: "Fulcrum solves a key problem in human-computer interaction (HCI) research — the need to master and coordinate multiple tools throughout the research process. This platform emerged from observing researchers struggle to integrate disparate systems across their studies. The proposed solution combines study design, participant sessions, data collection, and analysis in a single web-based platform. Researchers maintain full control over study customization while establishing consistent processes that improve study quality. A minimal dashboard presents study results through clear visualizations that highlight patterns in learning, task performance, and user behavior. By bringing everything together, research teams spend more time on research and less time managing technology. Built with current web technologies, Fulcrum adapts to different research approaches rather than forcing researchers to change their methods. The system supports both today's needs and tomorrow's analytical possibilities. The booth demonstration shows Fulcrum in action within actual research settings, illustrating how this unified approach makes HCI studies more efficient and effective."
