Couple ways of doing this:
- One way, using time to record the data points.
    Ex: every 1 second record a point
    pros: creates less lag
    cons: less data points


- Second way, record using distance from previous points
    Ex: Record every 100 pixels
    pros: more data
    cons: creates a little lag
